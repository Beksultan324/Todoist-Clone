The rotating nature of some Roles engages people to learn and grow. It forces a person to focus on specific responsibilities, avoiding problems related to shared responsibilities (mean no responsibilities). At the same time, rotating helps to not get bored or overwhelmed.",

Micromanagement and bureaucracy ruin trust as the foundation of a healthy, collaborative, and constantly improving team. Lead isn't obliged to be an example of perfection but rather should not be afraid to fail, own up mistakes, and commit to learning among teammates. Nobody is able to oversee the complexity and fragility of collaboration, so improving retrospectively is the best way to go.",
